In this work we implement a Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet) for COVID-19 medical image (CXR) classification task. 
ResNet solves the vanishing gradient problem, allowing deeper networks constructions by adding more layers and making the algorithm easier to train.
A dimensional reduction technique (PCA) is used for an efficient usage of the available computational resources. 
Moreover, data augmentation approach implemented enrich the data set by obtaining more images for the algorithm training, 
in consequence, nine hyperparameters were chosen related to model configurations and data augmentation operations. 
Hyperparameters were fixed using a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization approach, which allows to improve the model performance and accuracy. 
Experimental results showed that techniques applied to ResNet architecture helps to obtain good accuracy and training performance when a small
data sets and limited computational resources are available.â€©
